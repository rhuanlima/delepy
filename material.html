    <div class="content">
        <p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Laboratories over a period starting in 1979. Since
            C++ is an attempt to add object-oriented features (plus other improvements) to C, earlier it was
            called as “C with Objects”. As the language developed, Stroustrup named it as C++ in 1983.</p>

        Arrays
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store
            multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each
            element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first
            element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array). The base value is index 0 and
            the difference between the two indexes is the offset.</p>

        <p>For simplicity, we can think of an array as a fleet of stairs where on each step is placed a
            value (let’s say one of your friends). Here, you can identify the location of any of your
            friends by simply knowing the count of the step they are on. </p>

        Calling a Function
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least
            one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional
            functions. You can divide up your code into separate functions.</p>
